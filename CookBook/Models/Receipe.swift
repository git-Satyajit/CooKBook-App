Cover with a lid and let it cook for 30 minutes until the mutton turns tender and juicy. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.", time: 60),
        Receipe(id: UUID().uuidString, name: "Roast Chicken", image: "chicken", instructions: "To prepare a delicious roast chicken, begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Clean the chicken by removing any giblets and pat it dry with paper towels. Rub the entire surface of the chicken with olive oil and season generously inside and out with salt, pepper, and herbs like rosemary, thyme, and sage. Optionally, stuff the cavity with halved lemons and garlic cloves to enhance the flavor. Place the chicken breast-side up in a roasting pan. Tuck the wing tips under the body and tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Roast in the oven for about 20 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the juices run clear. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before carving to allow the juices to redistribute. Serve with roasted vegetables or a light salad for a hearty, satisfying meal.", time: 50),

First, prepare the meat sauce by sautéing chopped onions and garlic in olive oil until translucent. Add ground beef or a mix of mutton and pork, and cook until browned. Stir in a can of crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper, and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg, grated Parmesan, and chopped parsley. To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of meat sauce in a baking dish, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles (no need to boil if using oven-ready noodles). Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a generous layer of cheese. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes until the top is bubbly and golden. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before slicing to help the layers set. Serve warm with a side of garlic bread or a green salad.", time: 60),
        Receipe(id: UUID().uuidString, name: "Omelette", image: "omelette", instructions: "To prepare a basic omelette, start by beating 2-3 eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil. Once the butter is melted or the oil is hot, pour in the eggs. As the eggs begin to set, gently lift the edges with a spatula, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow underneath. When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add your chosen fillings—such as cheese, diced vegetables, herbs, or cooked meats—on one half of the omelette. Carefully fold the other half over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute or so, until the cheese is melted and the omelette is cooked through. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately. Enjoy a customizable and quick meal that's perfect for breakfast or a light dinner.", time: 10),
        Receipe(id: UUID().uuidString, name: "Pasta", image: "pasta", instructions: "To prepare pasta, start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Choose your pasta shape and add it to the boiling water, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Follow the cooking time suggested on the package, typically between 8 to 12 minutes, until the pasta is al dente, which means it should be tender but still firm to the bite. While the pasta cooks, you can prepare a sauce of your choice, such as a quick garlic and olive oil sauté, a creamy Alfredo, or a hearty marinara. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a cup of the pasta water. Return the pasta to the pot and mix it with your sauce, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce cling to the pasta smoothly. Serve immediately with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs for an extra touch of flavor.", time: 20),

If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up. Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet, dusted with flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Top with your favorite ingredients—mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, vegetables, or whatever you like. If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven; otherwise, place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve hot. Enjoy creating a variety of pizzas with different toppings for a fun and customizable meal.", time: 30),
        Receipe(id: UUID().uuidString, name: "Salad", image: "salad", instructions: "To prepare a fresh and vibrant salad, begin by choosing a variety of greens such as romaine, arugula, spinach, or mixed baby leaves as your base. Wash and dry the greens thoroughly. In a large bowl, add the cleaned greens along with a mix of colorful vegetables like sliced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onions, and bell peppers. For added texture and flavor, incorporate ingredients such as nuts, seeds, crumbled cheese, or fresh herbs. To dress the salad, whisk together a simple vinaigrette of olive oil, vinegar (like balsamic or red wine), a touch of honey, mustard, salt, and pepper. Drizzle the dressing over the salad just before serving and toss well to coat every leaf. This ensures your salad remains crisp and not soggy. Serve immediately as a light main dish or alongside your favorite entrée for a complete meal.", time: 10),

                    "Make the dough: To a bowl add the flour, oats, salt, and spices and mix well.Heat one cup of water, until almost boiling, and add the buckwheat.Let it sit for 2 minutes to cook and rehydrate and add the buckwheat to the flour mixture.Add 2 teaspoons of oil and another 1/4 cup of water.Press and mix.Depending on your flour you might need some more water.Add 1-2 tablespoons of water at a time until the mixture will get slightly sticky.Use your oiled hands and not a spatula to bring the dough together.Add a couple more tablespoons of water if needed.This will take no more than 2 minutes to press and bring everything together.Once the dough comes together, knead for a couple more seconds.Brush one teaspoon of oil on the dough and cover it with a napkin or a plate and;;;; let itSit; for 15 minutes.Make the filling: In the meantime prepare the filling.Cook your potatoes if you haven t already either in the pressure cooker or in a pot.To cook them in the instant pot just add the whole potatoes and cover them with water and pressure cook for 10 minutes for medium-sized potatoes.Let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes then quick release.Transfer the potatoes to a bowl to cool for a little bit then peel and mash them.To cook them in a saucepan, peel the potatoes, cube them and add them to a saucepan.Cover with water, bring to a boil, and boil over medium-high heat for 12-15 minutes depending on their size.Check the potatoes if they are cooked.Drain, add to a bowl, and mash.Add the hempseeds, chia seeds, turmeric, salt, and spices, annd the optional onion, chili, cilantro if using,and mix well.Add the chia seeds to the hot potatoes so that the chia seeds will absorb the moisture.If the potatoes are already cold, the chia seeds won t really absorb much moisture.Mix and mash really well and set aside for a few minutes.Make the aloo paratha Oil your hands really well and knead the dough for a few seconds.Divide the dough into 10 equal size balls.Cover them again with the napkin.For each dough ball, roll it between your hands, use a little bit of flour to dust the surface, and roll it with a rolling pin.When rolling, you want to keep the edges of the dough thinner and the center thicker (see pictures and video).Take about 2-3 tablespoons of the potato filling and place it in the middle of the flatbread.Fold the flatbread as you like.I usually make squares by folding one and then the other side then pressing it so that the sides stick.Then fold the top and the bottom and press again so it sticks.Then using some more flour, dust both sides.To roll it out you need to press it down a little bit first then roll it out with the rolling pin.Roll it gently on the side that doesn t have the folding.And again roll lightly without applying too much pressure on the side with the folding.Once the square is about 6-7 inches set it aside.Repeat for all the flatbreads.I usually roll out 3 or 4 and then start cooking them on the skillet.If this is your first time making them, it s better to first roll them all out and then cook them.If you have any extra filling you can just form it into patties or if you don t have enough filling for the last one or two, you can just eat them plain without any filling.Then heat your skillet over medium-high heat.Once the skillet is hot, place the flatbread onto the skillet and cook for 30 seconds or until golden brown.Flip to cook the other side and cook for another 30 seconds.Drizzle a few drops of oil and flip it and press and cook, 1 min or so (cook time depends on your skillet, stove, and how much heat is getting transferred to the flatbread) . Repeat with the rest of the flatbreads until both sides are golden brown.Set aside on a plate or storage container.Serve hot topped with vegan butter with some cumin spiced non dairy yogurt with shredded cucumber( raita) or chutneys like my tomato chutney, mango chutney, or Indian pickles(achar) or curries.Making aloo parathas can be tricky so definitely check out the recipe tips to make them ", time: 40),
        Receipe(id: UUID().uuidString, name: "Vegan Waffles", image: "Vegan_Waffles", instructions: "Ingredients for Easy Vegan Waffles and Substitution options: * I use a mix of flours to make the waffle mix for a crispy and hearty result, You can use just all purpose flour if you like. * All Purpose flour keeps the waffles light and fluffy * Whole wheat pastry flour helps with adding more structure * Almond flour and starch help with crispyness. You can use rice flour as a substitute for almond flour to keep the mix nut-free. * flax meal adds a bit of moist binding. It is optional. These ingredients make the dry mix. * Baking powder adds leavening * Some sugar or sweetener in the batter makes lightly sweet waffles * A small amount of salt balances out the sweet * Non dairy milk such as almond, soy or light coconut work out the best. Other light non dairy milks will work as well. * A bit of oil helps with crispyness. You can omit it if you prefer. * Vanilla extract adds flavor * I love some additional flavor from a few drops of almond extract or a fourth tsp of cinnamon. How to make Vegan Waffles: Assemble the ingredients. Whisk all the dry ingredients in a bowl to mix well. Add the non dairy milk, flavors and oil and whisk until smooth. Let the batter sit for a bit and then adjust if needed with extra non dairy milk or flour. Preheat the waffle maker and grease it if needed. Add the recommended amount of batter. You can adjust the amounts based on the preferred thickness and crispyness of the waffle. Use lesser batter for crispier waffles. Keep the waffles warm in the oven then stack and serve with toppings of choice. Are these the Best Vegan Waffles?! you tell me 🙂 ", time: 60),
        Receipe(id: UUID().uuidString, name: "Chicken Biryani", image:"Chicken_Biryani", instructions: "Mix Marinade in a large pot (about 26cm / 11″ diameter). Add chicken and coat well. Marinade 20 minutes to overnight. Par Boiled Rice: Bring 3 litres / 3 quarts water to the boil, add salt and spices. Add rice, bring back up to the boil then cook for 4 minutes, or until rice is just cooked still a bit firm in the middle. Rice will taste salty at this stage, disappears in next stage of cooking. Drain immediately. Set aside. (Note 10 re: leaving whole spices in) Crispy Onions: Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook onion, in batches, for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Don’t burn – they become bitter. Remove onto paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining onion. Saffron: Place in a bowl, leave for 10 minutes+. Biryani: Place pot with chicken in it onto a stove over medium heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove lid. Cook for 5 minutes, turning chicken twice. Remove from heat. Turn chicken so skin side is down – it should cover most of the base of the pot. Scatter over half the onion then half the coriander. Top with all the rice. Gently pat down and flatten surface. Drizzle saffron across rice surface in random pattern, then drizzle over ghee. Place lid on. Return to stove over medium heat. As soon as you see steam, turn down to low then cook for 25 minutes. Remove from stove, rest with lid on for 10 minutes. To Serve: Aim to serve it so you get nice patches of yellow rice, white rice, the curry stained rice + chicken (rather than all mixed up). To do this, use a large spoon and dig deep into the pot, and try to scoop up as much as you can in one scoop. Turn out into bowl – or onto platter. Garnish with remaining onion and coriander with yoghurt on the side (see Note 7 for Minted Yoghurt)", time: 90)
